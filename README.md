# ACO-GWAS
Code used to carry our my final year project titled "*Using Ant Colony Optimization to explore gene-gene interactions associated with Type 2 Diabetes*" as part of my BSc Computer Science degree at the University of Exeter. 

This repo will not be maintained, but if anyone wants to turn this in to a polished piece of software feel free to submit pull requests. 

The issues I'm aware of have been added to issues, please read these and the warning below before using.

WARNING: 
This tool was created to carry out specific tests for **specific data**, rather than a generic tool to carry out epistatic interaction studies using ACO. The code has not been tested on other datasets, there are known bugs and it will likely not be maintained, **do not use this tool to produce results for published work**.
